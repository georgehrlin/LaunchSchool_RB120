Given the error message, `hi` is a private method and it cannot be called outside of a class (for the most part) like what line 2 does. There are a few ways to fix it depending on the intentions of how `hi` should work: First, `hi` can be made a public method instead; second, an instance method that calls `hi` can be created inside the `Person` class, then `hi` can be called implicitly via that instance method outside of the class.
